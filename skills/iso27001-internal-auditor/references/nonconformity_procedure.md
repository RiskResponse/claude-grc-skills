## 1. Scope

All problems and potential improvements identified within the information security management system (ISMS) fall within the scope of this procedure.

This procedure also serves as an improvement suggestion scheme.

The objective of this procedure is to ensure that problems, nonconformities, and improvements are dealt with in an efficient and effective manner, minimising the chances of any recurrence.

This procedure aims to ensure that processes, services and controls that do not conform to specified requirements are not used, or relied upon, until they are corrected.

Complaints are subject to the same process described in this document.

## 3. Procedure

### 3.1
When a problem or potential improvement is identified, each Employees/Staff has a duty to inform their **[Role/Manager]** of the issue, either verbally or by using a Nonconformity Report.

### 3.2
Any Employees/Staff or third party who becomes aware of an issue that does not meet Westhill's defined approach and standards, or that has the potential for such an adverse effect, must raise a Nonconformity Report immediately and forward it to the appropriate **[Role]**.

### 3.3
The **[Role]** obtains a Nonconformity Report Log Number from the **[Role]** if one has not already been assigned. For actions within their area of responsibility, evaluates whether the issue is valid and its priority.

### 3.4
The **[Role]** determines whether the nonconformity is isolated, if there are similar nonconformities, or if the cause of the nonconformity has resulted or could result in other nonconformities.

### 3.5
The **[Role]** agrees a course of action and timescale to correct the issue, dependent upon the effect the issue is likely to have and to what degree. The agreed actions may rectify and prevent recurrence of the issue, or the consequences can be accepted. Such actions are recorded on the Nonconformity Report and a copy is sent to the **[Role]**.

### 3.6
Actions to correct nonconformities will be reviewed as described in 3.13 below. As such, the **[Role]** and the **[Role]** will also need to agree a timeline for review and any necessary metrics for establishing whether the corrective action has been successful. These details are recorded on the Nonconformity Report and mirrored in the copy held by the **[Role]**.

### 3.7
If related nonconformities as identified in 3.4 above remain untreated by the action determined in 3.5 above, the **[Role]** will raise a new Nonconformity Report as detailed in 3.2 above and follow this procedure accordingly.

### 3.8
Timescales for completion should have regard to the cost/benefit of the nonconformity and other reasonable business priorities.

### 3.9
On receipt of forms with no log number, the **[Role]** assigns one, evaluates the report and forwards it to the appropriate **[Role]** who will act as in 3.4 above.

### 3.10
The **[Role]** will regularly monitor the progress of outstanding Nonconformity Reports. If any action has not been completed by the previously agreed date, they will agree and record new actions and/or dates. If not satisfied that achievable progress is being made, they will escalate the matter to higher line management responsible for that area.

### 3.11
Nonconformity Reports will be closed down by the **[Role]** once the issue has been addressed and proof of consideration to preventive measures can be demonstrated; this may result in a review by scheduled or additional Internal Audits (see the Internal Audit Procedure). This is recorded on the Nonconformity Report and the corresponding log entry is updated.

### 3.12
A copy of the completed form is sent to the originator (internally raised issues) for their information (except in the cases of those generated at Internal Audit).

### 3.13
The **[Role]** will review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken after a time period determined on the basis of the action and the nonconformity it addresses, as described in 3.6 above. If the corrective action fails to adequately address the nonconformity, a new Nonconformity Report should be raised to address it.
