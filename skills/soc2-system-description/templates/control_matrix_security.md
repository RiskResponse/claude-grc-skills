# Security Control Matrix (TSC SEC - Common Criteria)

> **TIP**: Refer to `references/common_saas_controls.md` for a library of standard controls you can copy/paste into this matrix.

## Purpose

This control matrix maps your organization's controls to the Security Common Criteria requirements. Use this to ensure complete coverage of all TSC points and to track control testing.

**How to Use**:
1. For each TSC point, document which control(s) address it
2. Describe the control briefly
3. Note testing method
4. Reference evidence
5. Mark as complete when documented

## SUMMARY

**Total TSC Points:** 35
**Documented:** __ / 35
**Coverage Percentage:** __%

**Gaps Identified:**
[List any TSC points not yet addressed]

**Compensating Controls:**
[Document any compensating controls for gaps]

**N/A Items:**
[Document any TSC points that don't apply with justification]

---

## NOTES

Use this matrix to:
- Track which controls address which TSC points
- Ensure no TSC points are missed
- Plan control testing with auditor
- Document control changes year-over-year

One control can address multiple TSC points.
Multiple controls can address one TSC point.

The key is ensuring every TSC point is covered by at least one effective, testable control.
